		The Room is a 2003 American independent romantic drama film written, directed, and produced by Tommy Wiseau, 
		who also stars in the film alongside Juliette Danielle and Greg Sestero. Set in San Francisco, the film is 
		centred around a melodramatic love triangle between amiable banker Johnny (Wiseau), his deceptive fianc√©e Lisa 
		(Danielle), and his conflicted best friend Mark (Sestero). The work was reportedly intended to be
		semi-autobiographical in nature.
